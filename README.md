# DRAG AND DROP using 'react-beautiful-dnd'

#### Project Idea/Instructions

The original creator (Rajat S) posted instruction on [Medium](https://blog.bitsrc.io/implement-better-drag-and-drop-in-your-react-app-beafc4451599), but the repo was flawed. I'm creating this one so I can get a better understanding of this library.

After forking and cloning, run the following;

```js
npm i
npm start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
